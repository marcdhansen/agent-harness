  "success_metrics": [
    "Hardened branch-issue coupling and started state in Orchestrator.",
    "Hardened get_active_issue_id to prevent fallback to 'bd ready' on feature branches.",
    "Added mandatory branch-issue coupling check to Turbo Mode initialization.",
    "Created and passed automated tests for coupling hardening."
  ],
  "technical_learnings": [
    "Identified that get_active_issue_id had a fallback to bd ready which allowed unrelated issues to satisfy coupling checks on feature branches.",
    "Feature branches must be strictly coupled to their namesake issue.",
    "Turbo Mode initialization was bypassing coupling checks, allowing work on misnamed branches."

    "Navigated complex validator dependencies and logic holes."
