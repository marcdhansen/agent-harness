{"id":"agent-harness-2rn","title":"Standardize structured JSON for reflection capture","description":"## Problem\nReflection currently uses interactive prompts or ad-hoc formats. During session, agent discovered that using a structured JSON template was more effective.\n\n## Proposed Enhancement\nMake .reflection_input.json the standard reflection artifact:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_name\": \"string (required)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"SUCCESS | PARTIAL | FAILURE (required)\",\n  \"duration_hours\": \"number\",\n  \"success_metrics\": {\"key\": \"value\"},\n  \"technical_learnings\": [\"string\"],\n  \"challenges_overcome\": [\"string\"],\n  \"protocol_issues\": [\"string\"],\n  \"process_improvements\": [\"string\"],\n  \"quantitative_results\": {\"key\": \"value\"}\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- Machine-readable for validation scripts\n- Consistent format across all sessions\n- Non-interactive (works in automated environments)\n- Aggregatable for pattern analysis\n- Reduces cognitive load - fill template vs free-form\n\n## Changes Needed\n1. Update SOP to require .reflection_input.json\n2. Update --retrospective check to verify JSON exists\n3. Update /reflect skill to generate structured JSON\n\n## Origin\nEmergent method discovered during session - should become standard.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T15:58:18.649593Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-07T15:58:18.649593Z"}
{"id":"agent-harness-6qg","title":"Convert SOP checklists to JSON format","description":"## Problem\nSOP checklists are currently in Markdown format with `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes. Agents and validation scripts must parse markdown to track state, which is error-prone.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nConvert phase checklists to structured JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"finalization\",\n  \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": \"quality_gates\", \"label\": \"Run quality gates\", \"complete\": true},\n    {\"id\": \"git_clean\", \"label\": \"Git status clean\", \"complete\": false}\n  ],\n  \"blockers\": [\"git_clean\"],\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-07T16:00:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- **Parsing**: Native structure vs regex for markdown\n- **State tracking**: Boolean fields vs text manipulation\n- **Validation**: Schema validation vs manual verification\n- **Programmatic updates**: Object mutation vs string replacement\n- **Orchestrator integration**: Check `blockers.length === 0` vs regex\n\n## Implementation\n1. Create JSON schema for phase checklists\n2. Generate JSON files for each phase\n3. Update Orchestrator to read/validate JSON\n4. Keep markdown for human readability (generated from JSON)\n\n## Origin\nFollows pattern established for .reflection_input.json - structured data reduces cognitive load.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T16:02:38.331261Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-07T16:02:38.331261Z"}
