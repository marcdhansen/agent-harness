Agents and validation scripts must parse markdown to track state, which is error-prone.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nConvert phase checklists to structured JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"phase\": \"finalization\",\n  \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n  \"items\": [\n    {\"id\": \"quality_gates\", \"label\": \"Run quality gates\", \"complete\": true},\n    {\"id\": \"git_clean\", \"label\": \"Git status clean\", \"complete\": false}\n  ],\n  \"blockers\": [\"git_clean\"],\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-07T16:00:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\n## Benefits\n- **Parsing**: Native structure vs regex for markdown\n- **State tracking**: Boolean fields vs text manipulation\n- **Validation**: Schema validation vs manual verification\n- **Programmatic updates**: Object mutation vs string replacement\n- **Orchestrator integration**: Check `blockers.length === 0` vs regex\n\n## Implementation\n1. Create JSON schema for phase checklists\n2. Generate JSON files for each phase\n3. Update Orchestrator to read/validate JSON\n4. Keep markdown for human readability (generated from JSON)\n\n## Origin\nFollows pattern established for .reflection_input.json - structured data reduces cognitive load.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"hansen.marc@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T16:02:38.331261Z","created_by":"Marc Hansen","updated_at":"2026-02-10T15:26:57.637711Z","closed_at":"2026-02-10T15:26:57.637711Z","close_reason":"Closed","comments":[{"id":13,"issue_id":"agent-harness-6qg","author":"Marc Hansen","text":"## Implementation Details \u0026 Documentation\n\n### 📁 Files Created/Modified\n-  - JSON Schema for SOP checklists.\n-  - Six phase-based checklists in structured JSON format.\n-  - Core  and classes for loading/running checks.\n-  - Updated with 10+ new validators to support the JSON system.\n-  - Refactored to use .\n-  - Refactored  and  to use .\n-  - Utility to generate human-readable MD from JSON source.\n-  - Integration tests for the checklist system.\n\n### 🚀 Quick Start\nTo run the compliance checks manually:\n```bash\npython3 -m agent_harness.compliance --init\n```\nTo regenerate the Markdown documentation:\n```bash\npython3 src/agent_harness/scripts/generate_checklist_md.py\n```\n\n### 📖 Key Documentation\n- **SOP Checklist MD**: `.agent/docs/SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`\n- **JSON Source**: `.agent/rules/checklists/`\n\n### 🔧 Integration Points\n- The Orchestrator now loads phase definitions from JSON at runtime.\n- Validators are registered by name in the node, allowing easy extension via JSON changes.\n","created_at":"2026-02-10T15:21:01Z"},{"id":14,"issue_id":"agent-harness-6qg","author":"Marc Hansen","text":"## Implementation Details \u0026 Documentation\n\n### 📁 Files Created/Modified\n\n- `.agent/rules/sop_checklist.schema.json` - JSON Schema for SOP checklists.\n- `.agent/rules/checklists/*.json` - Six phase-based checklists in structured JSON format.\n- `src/agent_harness/checklists.py` - Core `ChecklistManager` and classes for loading/running checks.\n- `src/agent_harness/compliance.py` - Updated with 10+ new validators to support the JSON system.\n- `src/agent_harness/nodes/initialization.py` - Refactored to use `ChecklistManager`.\n- `src/agent_harness/nodes/finalization.py` - Refactored `finalization_node` and `retrospective_node` to use `ChecklistManager`.\n- `src/agent_harness/scripts/generate_checklist_md.py` - Utility to generate human-readable MD from JSON source.\n- `tests/test_sop_json_validation.py` - Integration tests for the checklist system.\n\n### 🚀 Quick Start\n\nTo run the compliance checks manually:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m agent_harness.compliance --init\n```\n\nTo regenerate the Markdown documentation:\n\n```bash\npython3 src/agent_harness/scripts/generate_checklist_md.py\n```\n\n### 📖 Key Documentation\n\n- **SOP Checklist MD**: `.agent/docs/SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`\n- **JSON Source**: `.agent/rules/checklists/`\n\n### 🔧 Integration Points\n\n- The Orchestrator now loads phase definitions from JSON at runtime.\n- Validators are registered by name in the node, allowing easy extension via JSON changes.","created_at":"2026-02-10T15:21:16Z"}]}
