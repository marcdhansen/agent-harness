# Progress Log: agent-harness-50r

## Activities
- Researched SOP closure rules.
- Drafted implementation plan v2 with modernized terminology.
- Updated AGENTS.md.
- Implemented closure gate validator in finalization_validator.py.
- Integrated check into finalization.json.
- Verified with PR #23 and Beads label 'in_review'.

## Reflector Synthesis
The session successfully addressed the gap in SOP enforcement regarding issue closure. By strictly requiring the 'in_review' label for open PRs, we ensure that issues remain visible and correctly categorized until merged. 

Key takeaway: Beads finite status set requires creative use of labels for custom workflow states. Modernizing terminology from 'Landing the Plane' to 'Session Finalization' aligns the project with standard professional practices.
