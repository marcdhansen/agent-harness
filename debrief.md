## 1. Session Summary

Successfully modernized terminology across the `agent-harness` repository and global `dot-gemini` configuration. Replaced all legacy mission/aviation terms (PFC, IFO, RTB, Flight Director) with modern agentic counterparts (Initialization, Execution, Finalization, Orchestrator).

## 2. Multi-Phase Implementation Assessment

**Implementation Type**: Single-phase implementation
**Hand-off Assessment**: Not applicable

---

## 3. Reflection Synthesis

- **Terminology Alignment**: Modernizing terms reduces cognitive load by using standard dev-centric industry concepts.
- **Global Consistency**: Updating `~/.agent` documentation alongside local changes ensures cross-agent compatibility.
- **Quality Gates**: Fixed lint errors in `ONBOARDING.md` and `tdd-workflow.md` to maintain high documentation standards.

## 4. Improvement Suggestions

### 🤖 Agentic Design Patterns

- Consider: Could any part of this work be parallelized across agents?
- Review: Are there clear handoff points that could improve multi-agent workflows?
- Evaluate: Would task decomposition benefit from explicit dependency declarations?

---

## 5. Strategic Analysis Questions

### Cognitive Load Reduction

- QUESTION: Are there parts of the SOP where the agent's cognitive load could be reduced by using scripts?
- Review manual steps in Initialization/Finalization that could be automated
- Identify repeated decision points that could have default behaviors

### Design Patterns & Refactoring

- QUESTION: Identify design patterns and recommended refactoring strategies.
- Consider: Are there emerging patterns that should be formalized as skills?
- Evaluate: Would template-based approaches reduce boilerplate work?

---

## 6. Harness Self-Evolution (MANDATORY)

### RBT Analysis

- **Roses** (Successes): The systematic recursive search and replace ensured no mission-oriented terms were left behind in core SOP documents.
- **Buds** (Potential): Automated terminology migration scripts could be developed for future protocol evolutions.
- **Thorns** (Challenges): Encountered several duplicate heading lint errors in `ONBOARDING.md` which required manual de-duplication.

### Protocol Validity

- [x] Orchestrator was accurate in its checks (Terminology updated locally and globally)
- [x] `task.md` remained the living source of truth (N/A for this documentation-heavy task, but SOP followed)
- [x] `SKILL.md` updates were proposed for new learnings (Updated `initialization-briefing` and `retrospective` skills)

### Memory Sync

- [x] All session learnings synced to AutoMem Knowledge Graph
- [x] OpenViking temporal state persisted
