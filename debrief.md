## 2. Multi-Phase Implementation Assessment

**Implementation Type**: Multi-phase detected
**Hand-off Completed**: ❌ No
**Compliance Score**: 0%
**Quality Assessment**: No multi-phase implementation detected

### Process Efficiency Insights
- Hand-off process incomplete - blocks phase transitions

### Successor Agent Readiness
**Readiness Level**: N/A

## 3. Reflection Synthesis

### Key Learnings
- Finalization protocol mentioned pruning but scripts didn't implement it.
- Orchestrator init lacks clean state verification for local branches.
- Cross-repo sidecars (.gemini, .agent) also accumulate branch drift.
- Turbo mode git status check currently allows uncommitted metadata changes (.md files).
- Finalization protocol should always mandate a clean working tree to prevent workspace drift.

### Friction Points Identified
- Manual audit of 10+ branches to verify merge status.
- Formalize reflection sharing as a mandatory handoff step.
- Enforce check_git_status(turbo=False) for all finalization phases.
- Created P0 issues to automate branch pruning and init-state verification.
- Resolving hanging rebase state from previous agent session.

## 4. Improvement Suggestions

### 🔧 Friction Reduction
- High commit frequency detected. Consider batching related changes.
- Address friction point: Manual audit of 10+ branches to verify merge status.
- Address friction point: Formalize reflection sharing as a mandatory handoff step.
- Address friction point: Enforce check_git_status(turbo=False) for all finalization phases.

### 🤖 Agentic Design Patterns
- Consider: Could any part of this work be parallelized across agents?
- Review: Are there clear handoff points that could improve multi-agent workflows?
- Evaluate: Would task decomposition benefit from explicit dependency declarations?

---

## 5. Strategic Analysis Questions

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- QUESTION: Are there parts of the SOP where the agent's cognitive load could be reduced by using scripts?
- Review manual steps in Initialization/Finalization that could be automated
- Identify repeated decision points that could have default behaviors

### Design Patterns & Refactoring
- QUESTION: Identify design patterns and recommended refactoring strategies.
- Consider: Are there emerging patterns that should be formalized as skills?
- Evaluate: Would template-based approaches reduce boilerplate work?

## 6. Harness Self-Evolution (MANDATORY)

### RBT Analysis
- **Roses** (Successes): IDENTIFY what part of the harness/SOP worked perfectly.
- **Buds** (Potential): IDENTIFY an emerging improvement for the next session.
- **Thorns** (Challenges): IDENTIFY one failure point in the protocol today.

### Protocol Validity
- [ ] Orchestrator was accurate in its checks
- [ ] `task.md` remained the living source of truth
- [ ] `SKILL.md` updates were proposed for new learnings

### Memory Sync
- [ ] All session learnings synced to AutoMem Knowledge Graph
- [ ] OpenViking temporal state persisted
